    <p>I know you didn't specifically ask for it, but I would like to start with the "Airing of the Grievences."  Just one at least.  Being loosely type is a quick that definitely takes some getting used to.  Is it an integer, a string, an array.  Who knows?  Who cares?!  Dealing with this quirk has caused many headaches over the years.</p>
    <p>On to the good parts.  I really enjoy anonymous functions and find myself utilizing them quite often.  I believe over languages have caught up on this behavior, which I'm grateful for, as I've found I write code in that pattern almost exclusively. Using this pattern does allow for the creation of some very concise code.</p>

  <dt>Describe the challenges that NAT imposes on VoIP systems, and describe at least one method for overcoming NAT.</dt>
  <dd>I'll be honest, I'm really not sure about this one.  I could obviously Google it, but I wanted to be honest.  Best guess... NAT would introduce latency into a VoIP system.  I would imagine a similar discussion would present itself of the difference between UDP and TCP.  I could see VoIP being in the unique situation where you want the speed of UDP, but also the reliability of TCP.</dd>

  <dt>On a scale from 1-10 (10 = highest), how would you rate your proficiency in computer networking?</dt>
  <dd>Perhaps a 7.  I'm obviously not as comfortable answering the VoIP through NAT question above, but I am comfortable in a lot of areas of networking.  DIG and NMAP are usually my go to tools for debugging.  I have a decent understanding of the differences between a modem, router, switch, and hub.</dd>
